# Generic OLingo (OData) JPA Adapter
This library implements functionality to enable CRUD operations for an JPA based data model in a OData (REST) environment.
Developers using this library have to write only a few lines of code to get a servlet running handling all typical operations to read, write/update and delete JPA entities as OData/REST resources. Additional supported out-of-the-box functionality defined by the [OData](http://www.odata.org/) standard is:
* Call Java methods like remote procedure call (RPC) as OData bound actions
* Sorting + filtering for results
